Problem statement - Design an in-memory cache using LFU(Least Frequently Used) as an eviction policy,
in case multiple keys are having same frequency apply LRU(Least Recently Used) on the subset of keys.
Let the initial capacity of the cache be 10.

Implement the below methods -

add(key, value) // make sure the time complexity of this method is not O(n).

value get(key) // make sure the time complexity of this method is not O(n).
